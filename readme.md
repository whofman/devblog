# Baseblog Kirby Theme

This theme is made to give you [a nice and clean start](http://sashtown.de/blog/what-baseblog-is) when it comes to creating a blog with Kirby. It allows you to set up your posts and pages quickly, so you can easily customize it and just start blogging right away. Here are some built-in features of Baseblog:

- post types (texts, links and videos)
- tags
- search
- error page
- RSS feed
- pagination for articles
- static tweet button
- responsiveness
- prearranged blueprints for Panel usage

## Installation
The easiest way to install Kirby with Baseblog is via terminal:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/sashtown/Baseblog-Kirby-Theme.git
```

If you've already installed Kirby with the Starterkit remove the default `/assets`, `/content` and `/site` folders and replace them with the downloaded ones from Baseblog.
